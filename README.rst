Sci Corpus
==========

Scientific corpus manager.

Dependencies:

* Python 2.7 >
* PySide 1.2 >
* sqlite3
* python - lxml

Installing
==========

To install, browse to your sci-corpus folder and run this following command:

# python setup.py install

It will automatically install all dependencies.

For Windows users, you need to use CMD as administrator and run inside the sci-corpus the following commands:

# c:\Python27\python.exe setup.py install

However, it eventually doesn't work because of its dependencies from Visual Studio for compiler .
So download the binaries from site.
