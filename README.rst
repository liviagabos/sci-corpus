Sci Corpus
==========

Scientific corpus manager.

Dependences:

* Python 2.7 >
* PySide 1.2 >
* sqlite3
* python - lxml

Installing
==========

To install run into sci-corpus folder this following command:

# python setup.py install

It will install the dependencies.

For Windows users, you need to use CMD as administrator and run inside the sci-corpus the following commands:

# c:\Python27\python.exe setup.py install

But eventually it not works because of its dependencies from Visual Studio for compiler. 
So download the binaries from site.
